# Slackfiles

Slack has message and storage [limits](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/115002422943-Message-and-storage-limits-on-the-Free-plan) on its free plan. Workspaces on the free plan share a total of 5GB of file storage space. With a team of just a few dozen people, it's quite easy to push past that 5GB storage limit. What's moreâ€”an administrator can't just hit the "clean files" button and restore that space. Users having files in private messages/channels must manually remove those files on their own. Have fun convincing your team to go and do that by hand.

`slackfiles.sh` (the best names are descriptive, [right](https://www.targetmarketingmag.com/article/choosing-a-business-name-descriptive-unique/all/)?) provides an easy command-line interface to manage file storage on Slack.
